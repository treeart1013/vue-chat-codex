# Vue Chat Codex

This project is a minimal Vue 3 setup intended to be the starting point for an AI chat application. It uses Vite for development and build tooling.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). The
   error overlay is disabled by default in `vite.config.js`.
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The main application code is in `src/` and the entry HTML file is `index.html`.
